		<p>Below are a few examples of what I have done during my developement career<br>
Please note that some of the below were developed during my time of learning and
are not showcases of my complete understanding but a focus on what I was learning
at the time. Where this is the case it will be mentioned in the description.</p>

            <a href="https://milestoneprojectmoviestore.herokuapp.com/"><h5>GitHub Repo</h5></a>
            <p>This application was made as part of learning how to be a developer, it was created to 
            showcase the use of Python and flask (Data Centric).<br>
            The user can search for a movie using the search bar and the application uses the OMdb API
            to return information about that movie, users can then leave reviews of that movie and read
            the reviews left by others. At this time I had not learned about user logins and could not
            provide functionality for that but the functions and page rendering is all handled by Python
            which is a back end language.</p>
