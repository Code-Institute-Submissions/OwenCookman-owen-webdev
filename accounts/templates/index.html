			<h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Owen Cookman and I am a freelance web developer.<br>
I grew up surrounded by a tech enthusiastic family. My father has always been interested in new technology and built
our family computers. My eldest brother also gained an interest in this and became a computer technician later in life.
My other brother studied computer science at university. During this time I also found an interest in coding and
learnt a small amount from him but later followed my passion for music, although an amazing skill to have it hasn't led
me to a career.<br>
Seizing the oportunity to retrain in a skill that both interested me and was in high demand I studied how to be a
software developer focusing on the process of designing and building websites from start to finish.</p>

			<h2 class="title">What I Do</h2>
			<p>As a Fullstack developer I handle both the front end and back end of the development process. The front
				end involves the design and overall look of your website, if you have a design and look in mind I will
				try to make it
				a reality. I can also provide consultation and/or suggestions to help make your website more user
				friendly and more
				appealing to your target customers/audience. The front end is everything that you can see and interact
				with on the web
				page while the back end is the turning cogs that you can't see that make the features of your website
				work. The back end
				involves things such as databases where user information can be stored or where all of the information
				about your products are
				held to be rendered on to a page for your customer to see.<br>
Registering <a href="{% url 'registration' %}">here</a> will give you access to a contact page where you will be asked a few
				questions about your business and what you would like your website to do. I will contact you for any
				extra information that
				I might need and will keep you up to date throughout the development process. There will also be a
				status update in your
				personal profile.</p>
