Owen Cookman Web Developer
======

The objective of this webpage is to advertise myself as a web developer, showcasing my portfolio of previous projects which should be regularly updated as more projects are finished, giving those who visit the website an introduction to myself, the work I have done, a way to contact me for consultations and also a way to hire and pay me as a freelance developer.

## UX

The website is aimed at potential clients who would like to hire me as a developer.

### User Stories

As a visitor I expect:
1. To read about the developer and learn about their background
2. To see the developers portfolio of work to understand what they are capable of
3. To be able to contact the developer with any questions that I may have
4. To be able to hire the developer and pay them for their service
5. To navigate the website easily
6. The information to be laid out in an easy to view format
