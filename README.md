### Styling Choices

#### Colours
I wanted to aim for a neutral colour palette with this website as my clients could be looking to build websites with 
a whole range of themes. This led me to look at neutral colour groups and I settled on a Charcoal/opaque navbar, this 
would seperate the navbar from other sections of the page but allow it to be fixed and not obstruct too much on smaller
screens. I also decided that each section of content would have a navy blue background while the blank areas would be 
left white, this would allow the text to be left a white colour so that it still stood out on the page but also broke 
any long pages in to sections rather than being one long list of content.

#### Fonts
I decided to go with the Inria Sans font as it still looked professional and neat but also different from what is seen
on a lot of other web pages, I noticed that this paired well with the Roboto font so I decided that any titles or headers
would be styled with Inria Sans and any other blocks of text would use Roboto. This further breaks content up and keeps 
the page looking interesting.
