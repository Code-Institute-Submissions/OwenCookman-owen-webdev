				<p>Many media agencies will build their customer's websites with as much reusable code as possible.
					Although this is an effective strategy to build websites quickly it can also lead to recognisable
					features where two different websites look very similar. I will build you a website with any design
					ideas that you have in mind and will try to keep the website as close to your business image as
					possible. If you don't have images and logos for your business I can put you in touch with a graphic
					designer if needed.</p>
